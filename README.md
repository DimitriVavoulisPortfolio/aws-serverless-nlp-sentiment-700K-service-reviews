# Sentiment Analysis Model for Product Reviews

## Project Overview

This project is a production-ready DistilBERT Sentiment Analysis model for product reviews desgined as a low cost market research tool with the nuiance of an actual market researcher, it was trained with a dataset of over 4 million Amazon product reviews to work for a wide variety of products in a highly scalable manner. This project comes with designs for a serverless live demo in AWS. 

### Key Features

- Pre-trained DistilBERT model for sentiment analysis on product reviews
- Designed for low compute costs to maximize scalability
- Conversion from PyTorch to TensorFlow
- Data processing and tokenization pipeline
- Comprehensive testing of both original and converted models
- Designs of an AWS serverless architecture for a live demo with future deployment(TBD)

## Project Structure

1. **1-Data processing**: Script for data preparation
2. **2-CSV files(Production test)**: CSV file used for production testing(Full dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews)
3. **3-Tokenization and Training**: Tokenization process and initial model training
4. **4-distilbert_sentiment_model**: Original PyTorch DistilBERT model
5. **5-Testing model**: Scripts for testing the PyTorch model, both a write in and a CSV input script 
6. **6-PyTorch2TensorFlow**: Conversion script from PyTorch to TensorFlow
7. **7-tensorflow_model**: Converted TensorFlow model
8. **8-Testing converted model**: Scripts for testing the TensorFlow model, includes a write in one, and 2 CSV input ones, one for testing the model, one for production usage
